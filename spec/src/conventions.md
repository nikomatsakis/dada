# Conventions

This chapter describes the conventions used throughout this specification.

## Paragraph References

Specification paragraphs are labeled with semantic identifiers using the notation `r[topic.subtopic.detail]`. 

These labels serve multiple purposes:
- Cross-referencing within the specification
- Linking from RFC documents  
- Test annotations via `#:spec topic.subtopic.detail`

Identifiers use semantic names rather than numbers to remain stable as the specification evolves. Examples include:
- `r[syntax.string-literals.escape-sequences]`
- `r[permissions.lease.transfer-rules]`
- `r[types.classes.field-access]`

## Normative Language

This specification uses the following terms to indicate requirements:
- **must**: An absolute requirement
- **must not**: An absolute prohibition
- **should**: A strong recommendation
- **should not**: A strong recommendation against
- **may**: An optional feature or behavior
