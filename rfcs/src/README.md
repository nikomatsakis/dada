# Dada RFCs

This book contains RFCs (Request for Comments) for the Dada programming language. RFCs are proposals for language changes that document design decisions, rationale, and implementation plans.

## RFC Process

Each RFC goes through several stages:

- **Active**: Under discussion and refinement
- **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
- **Implemented**: Completed with working code
- **Rejected**: Not proceeding (kept for historical reference)
- **Withdrawn**: Author chose not to proceed

## Contributing
