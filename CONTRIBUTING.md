# Contributing to Dada

Dada is an open-source experimental project led by @nikomatsakis, partly as a creative outlet and stress relief valve.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Small PRs welcome**: Bug fixes and minor improvements are appreciated
- **Large changes need coordination**: Please reach out before starting significant work - I'm unlikely to have bandwidth to review large PRs without prior arrangement
- **This is a personal project**: While open source, Dada is currently run by fiat as an experimental playground

## Development Resources

If you're exploring the codebase or have arranged to contribute:

- `.development/` directory contains architecture and pattern documentation
- `.development/rfc.md` explains the RFC process for language changes
- `cargo dada test` runs the test suite
- `cargo dada run <file.dada>` executes Dada programs
